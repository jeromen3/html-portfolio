<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Jerome Nance III, a 19-year-old on a mission to fuse finance with the digital world. Currently pursuing a finance major at ASU, I'm a lifelong learner who seizes every opportunity to broaden my horizons through education. When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me immersed in the world of coding</p>

<p>My passion for coding is more than just a hobby; it's a journey of self-improvement and a commitment to staying on the cutting edge of technology. I believe that blending finance and technology can unlock incredible opportunities, and I'm excited to share my projects and experiences with you</p>

<p>Join me on this exciting journey as I explore the endless possibilities of web development and bring innovative solutions to life. Let's connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together!
